# CDC_Analysis
Using data from the CDC to track diseases and what might be their causes. Heavily based on data analysis

The data that the python programs is working on is not the data found in the cancer folder, this is just the sorted data so that people reading this project could have an idea of what I am working with.
The real data that is being used is a much larger text file downloaded from the CDC directly and currently only using the BYAREA.TXT file (has been added to the .gitignore file).
The link to the data is as follows: https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/dataviz/download_data.htm
